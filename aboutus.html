        <h3>Anvay Bhanap</h3>
        <p>Hey! <br>
          My name is Anvay and I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area.
          Some of my hobbies include photography and sleeping, both of which I want to improve upon this summer. <br>
          I’m currently a senior at San Jose State University and joined this course to broaden my skillset beyond the standard college curriculum. <br>
          Growing up in Silicon Valley, there was a considerable pressure to learn coding and pursue some form of engineering as a career, so I’m grateful that I confidently know which aspect of software engineering I want to focus on – frontend web development.

        <h3>Jesse Dills</h3>
        <p>Hi! Gregarious and affable are common terms that others have used to describe the nature of myself. I was born and raised in the rural Pacific Northwest, and I have a kindred connection to the great outdoors. I live in Virginia with my wife Cara, where we've made a home for each other. I'm new to the software development industry, and energized to channel my creativity in new ways. Interesting facts about myself: I am an awardee of Purple Heart medal for my service as an Airborne Combat Engineer. I have been a Paramedic. I've delivered medical supplies and toys for children in Bulgaria, and built two small schools and three health clinics in rural Nicaragua as part of two different humanitarian projects. I love to travel, especially when it includes outdoor activities such as backpacking or river trips. Lastly, my favorite beach is the Outer Banks, NC.</p>

        <h3>Matthew Cho</h3>
        <p>Matt is a Seattle native, born and raised. Growing up in the pacific northwest has instilled in him a love for nature, travel, and the outdoors. After spending way too much time at the University of Washington, he earned a degree in physiology and promptly decided that medical school was not in his future. He joined CodeFellows looking to pursue his interests and begin a career as a software developer.
